A bee to fields, of tribute well, 
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage, 
A book at mornings here read... 
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine: 
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote 
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love? 
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, - 
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all. 
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all, 
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, - 
About what she’s now dreaming? 
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing. 
A bowl 
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning, 
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse, 
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad. 
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women, 
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow, 
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words, 
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought, 
Adores my Olga: figure, breast! 
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring, 
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat. 
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused. 
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine 
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands; 
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth; 
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast, 
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau, 
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale 
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense. 
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy! 
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry, 
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling 
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love, 
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare — 
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench, 
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’. 
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected. 
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet? 
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love 
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt! 
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few). 
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady. 
Ah, many friends were near then! 
Ah, many were by fate denied! 
‘Ah, my Lord!’, 
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing. 
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence. 
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me! 
Ah, Olga gave the word to him, 
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful 
‘Ah, Tanya! 
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm, 
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read! 
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.- 
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings, 
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding 
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last. 
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order: 
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying, 
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat, 
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life. 
Alas! I must repeat again: 
Alas, it’s easy to divine! 
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child; 
Alas! On furrows of lives 
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute, 
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be. 
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles: 
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes. 
All barking, dogs to her are running. 
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry. 
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days. 
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light, 
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion, 
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay; 
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London 
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed. 
All flows in a single gear... 
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated, 
All have the supper. 
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing): 
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things, 
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day. 
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like 
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate. 
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge... 
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace; 
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light, 
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line. 
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade, 
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends, 
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’ 
All right, by hand unfair own 
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner; 
All’s blight, all’s white without shade. 
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why. 
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed, 
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins. 
All services of old time. 
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear, 
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared; 
All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv 
All that I don’t grasp. 
All that I gladlessly survived. 
- All they are yet feeling 
All they utter 
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste 
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation, 
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions, 
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading, 
All yet living 
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading, 
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth. 
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself. 
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous, 
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar, 
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads. 
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows 
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls... 
Already for triumph he’s waiting, 
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one, 
Alter him 
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain. 
A mere hit from all I’d give. 
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing. 
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds: 
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay, 
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time, 
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying? 
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace 
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife. 
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew. 
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook 
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish, 
Among the servants-maids-teenagers. 
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted, 
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields 
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour 
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes. 
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps. 
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner, 
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot, 
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled. 
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice, 
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’ 
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate 
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’ 
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen. 
And am I soon at thirties turn? 
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique, 
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear: 
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made. 
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young, 
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels. 
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend - 
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit: 
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see; 
And by the salt of worlds backbiting 
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising, 
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry... 
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn 
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking 
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate! 
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks. 
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun, 
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies. 
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life! 
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay. 
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air, 
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works) 
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here; 
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids. 
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine. 
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding 
And exclamations at the board: 
And fair sex like down’s slight... 
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him. 
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore 
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all 
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy. 
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily, 
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man, 
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet. 
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted; 
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed; 
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured. 
And give you all that 1 could scribble 
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts 
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step 
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given 
And gradually rises day. 
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age, 
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near! 
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself. 
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade 
And… he could not. 
And he inspired her at dawns! 
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests. 
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech! 
And here is the banns room. 
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had. 
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball. 
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already, 
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne 
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds 
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe 
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew! 
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’ 
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me 
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind? 
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read 
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving 
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love 
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm... 
And I’m in family unknown... 
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him. 
And in a day 
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar. 
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing, 
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him 
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more, 
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect? 
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in. 
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert, 
And is it true, it can’t return? 
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my, 
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’ 
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends. 
And I, while thinking of Swetlana, 
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less. 
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’ 
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says... 
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her, 
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping 
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving 
And let them God long live for us! 
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests, 
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves 
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly. 
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream, 
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides 
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice; 
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail; 
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams. 
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world 
And me you have in view... 
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast, 
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave, 
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night, 
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields), 
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press. 
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness. 
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word 
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered; 
And nothing cooled his strong belief: 
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that. 
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine 
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress, 
And now jealouser’s triumphant! 
And now North, all clouds driving, 
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads, 
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream. 
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs, 
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her. 
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away 
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night 
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night 
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys. 
And old barin room this had; 
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear. 
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took, 
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date; 
And passed away of tears time? 
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want; 
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time. 
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit. 
And quickly both they yet off 
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold 
Andryushka, quicker must you go! 
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears 
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour, 
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension 
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry, 
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes. 
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad. 
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing. 
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away... 
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean. 
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots 
And she has had 
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast. 
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe; 
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!... 
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew. 
And she, that young and lovely creature; 
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank. 
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream: 
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam 
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray! 
And so grew they old both. 
And stands at stint 
And stilly does she say at last: 
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word. 
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free. 
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin. 
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again 
And Tatyana’s nervous 
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true? 
And then at prince she was adjusting 
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation 
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day? 
And then he dressed himself... 
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he. 
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five, 
And then I thought: He’s now in; 
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again! 
And there… - 
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things, 
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish. 
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face, 
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life. 
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.- 
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him, 
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares; 
And. told her: 
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept. 
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf. 
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went; 
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave. 
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim. 
And unattentive smart lornette. 
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy, 
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison 
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy? 
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold... 
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring. 
And what? - 
And what. 
And what? 
And what? 
And what? 
And what can give me fate of mine?’ 
And what for is can now lurid? 
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead 
And what’s Onegin doing? 
And what’s the reason? 
And when a falling shining star 
And when sometimes in front of her 
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream? 
And where is her sister line? 
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’. 
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’ 
And who, d’you think, from it is looking? 
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock. 
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. - 
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’ 
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met! 
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner 
And with a bow 
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks: 
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date, 
And wondered: would he be alive?’ 
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination 
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment; 
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman 
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief, 
And you forgive, my freedom later! 
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean, 
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land 
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination, 
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender 
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away 
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle; 
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood. 
A need for sleep. 
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning. 
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring: 
Annette; And on the last one you read so: 
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth? 
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish, 
A passionate epistle’s writing. 
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then: 
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes. 
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me; 
Apostate of wild enjoyments, 
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess. 
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks. 
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated 
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel 
Are drying valleys many-coloured; 
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure, 
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion, 
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write. 
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows. 
Are silent. 
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn. 
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own, 
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed. 
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all? 
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble. 
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking, 
Arid thus we now part, forgive! 
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all, 
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades. 
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung. 
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men. 
Around Tanya ladies crowd, 
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though 
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness, 
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade: 
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook, 
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall. 
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings. 
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want 
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought, 
As if by greenish down covered. 
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent, 
A simple maiden 
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will. 
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage). 
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise: 
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating 
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie 
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish: 
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, - 
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate. 
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow, 
As quick as can 
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion, 
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim. 
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child 
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily... 
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that. 
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’ 
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed: 
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking. 
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom 
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),- 
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing 
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’. 
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life. 
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice; 
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you. 
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers, 
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes; 
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters; 
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age 
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world 
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last! 
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away; 
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein, 
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting; 
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies. 
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch. 
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend. 
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again. 
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts, 
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days. 
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding 
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot; 
At first his language me confused, 
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave 
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading, 
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone 
At first they’d nothing seen In common. 
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields 
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears. 
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides; 
At her much frightened loud cries 
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous 
At him she stares all the way: 
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died; 
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting. 
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self. 
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene 
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back 
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say 
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses. 
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate 
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling 
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving 
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling. 
At last it stopped. 
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole; 
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting 
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated, 
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech, 
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent, 
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless. 
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs: 
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness... 
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine, 
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh; 
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’ 
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared 
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band: 
At once was frightened my Tatyana... 
At other kinds of lines. 
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all. 
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks… 
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling, 
At rocks of the Caucasian districts 
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel, 
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings, 
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers, 
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile. 
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has 
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls. 
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place, 
At such a year, such an age. 
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks. 
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank. 
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all) 
At the games of maidenhood. 
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had. 
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting. 
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow. 
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret 
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain, 
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up. 
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine. 
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled 
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens) 
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip, 
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed. 
At window she now sits. 
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking, 
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing. 
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force 
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather 
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast. 
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting. 
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit 
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side, 
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’ 
Baratynsky. 
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet. 
Became alredy quite inapt. 
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion? 
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift 
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring, 
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks? 
Because she’s innocent and plain, 
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole 
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things? 
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim? 
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!); 
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on... 
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot... 
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote! 
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den, 
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared. 
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used. 
Behind the mill. 
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense. 
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you. 
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires, 
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife 
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit, 
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure 
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine. 
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese. 
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame, 
Bewildered and astonished hard... 
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes 
Boom could fade. 
‘Bordeaux’ all the times! 
Brothers! 
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while 
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies 
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother: 
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk, 
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque: 
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then. 
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal, 
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot: 
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated, 
But are you listening yet to me? 
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock. 
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes 
But at least 
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day: 
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day. 
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind, 
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion. 
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret! 
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance, 
But by your narrow small tracks, 
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres 
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve? 
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her! 
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up. 
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet... 
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be 
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats, 
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? - 
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them 
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared, 
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well, 
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us 
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate. 
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me. 
But forward, forward, you, my story! 
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps: 
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone. 
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection 
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce 
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison. 
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself... 
But his such sufferable shade, 
But hist! 
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’ 
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God. 
But how greatly Tanya’s altered! 
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating, 
But I 
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy. 
But I can hardly drag my feet, 
‘But I’d prefer another, 
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit. 
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack, 
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive. 
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be. 
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave, 
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse 
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation, 
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub: 
But in gloomy cliffs 
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash; 
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought 
But it is late, it’s time to go... 
But it’s enough to speak of her: 
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving, 
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe, 
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears, 
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts; 
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough, 
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have, 
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone 
But let me help with sacred water. 
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save, 
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance 
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this. 
But many days away could get 
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows? 
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract, 
But my fate 
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session: 
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt; 
But no answer... 
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss: 
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance 
But none she had! 
-But no one... 
But now... 
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading? 
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees; 
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies. 
But now doubts all are solved: 
But now, friends, from all my sides - 
But now - God! - is cooling blood 
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine, 
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam. 
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’ 
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men. 
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point. 
But other times in mind I bear! 
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls 
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0 
But really? 
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch 
But road alarm of love then filled me. 
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm; 
But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory. 
But send your boy, and first of all’ . 
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend, 
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace: 
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip? 
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes. 
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids, 
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair, 
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real 
But something more us separated... 
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim; 
But soon for husband, all at once, 
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away. 
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once: 
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying. 
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready! 
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape 
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did, 
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step.., 
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed; 
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps: 
But suddenly was changed it all: 
But summer’s flying quicker yet. 
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes. 
But Tanya now like in dream 
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came, 
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides, 
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid. 
But then a frenchman took her place. 
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings 
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far, 
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin, 
But then with books she could be dealing. 
But then your horse will try in fear 
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite... 
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?. 
But they would madden it too hard. 
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart, 
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’. 
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got, 
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion. 
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life, 
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose 
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use. 
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace, 
-But what about? 
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you? 
-But what is it - 
But what severe! 
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests 
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood, 
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few, 
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends, 
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again, 
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore, 
But where are you? Come! My rights 
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot. 
But where now through them speeds 
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail, 
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’ 
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife, 
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected? 
But whom to love? 
‘But who? plump general that big?’ 
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat.. 
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? - 
But why Talyana should be guilty? 
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him? 
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already 
But will it come, my day of freedom? 
But withered! 
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess. 
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head, 
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long". 
But yet she can’t. 
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best. 
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all. 
But you are tortured by the road. 
But you forgive him, games in stillness! 
Buyánov courted: was refused. 
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once: 
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun. 
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme; 
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed. 
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life. 
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting 
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay 
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan; 
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still. 
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient 
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night... 
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits. 
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays, 
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries: 
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs; 
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands; 
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered, 
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings, 
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva, 
By him were left at your employments. 
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes, 
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart; 
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up, 
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured, 
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished 
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep; 
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame, 
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried 
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly, 
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true. 
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail! 
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me 
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe, 
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again. 
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted, 
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates. 
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand, 
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving, 
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay, 
Byron 
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light, 
By sorcery of story’s secrets! 
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then. 
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite. 
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle, 
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself: 
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze; 
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood. 
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God. 
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud, 
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired? 
By winter carpets, snow-made. 
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us. 
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes, 
Came in. 
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field 
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time, 
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past? 
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed 
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us. 
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage 
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise. 
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live 
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare; 
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’ 
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways. 
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide; 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
CHAPTER THREE 
CHAPTER TWO 
Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came; 
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still 
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance. 
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests. 
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring, 
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms. 
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names, 
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring 
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods. 
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest, 
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained. 
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane. 
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it, 
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent 
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent; 
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze, 
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit 
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one. 
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough! 
Could my Onegin now find. 
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light, 
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face 
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry, 
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid 
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be... 
Decayed... 
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating, 
Decided is. 
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self. 
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates. 
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us. 
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all: 
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott. 
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day. 
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised, 
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature, 
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains 
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting, 
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see! 
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears 
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more. 
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy 
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own 
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image 
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush. 
Dmitriyev. 
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give). 
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone, 
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand... 
‘Do not.’ 
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you... 
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures, 
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’ 
D’you hear? 
- D’you joke - 
D’you know?... 
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear... 
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see... 
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils, 
Each claps. 
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you 
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear. 
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood 
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little 
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young, 
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear; 
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself. 
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste? 
Each shutter’s open, and dry 
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood 
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march. 
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew 
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days. 
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails. 
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired; 
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate, 
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours, 
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing, 
Enough... and has been done the burden: 
‘Enough, get up, I now must 
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world… 
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world. 
Enough, my dear... 
Enough, my friend, its all the same! 
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days. 
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette 
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love, 
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel, 
Etcetera. 
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise. 
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana 
Every country eater 
Exactly... 
Explain to you, do it frankly. 
Expresses death but not the torture. 
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad 
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well. 
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved, 
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver. 
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love. 
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel. 
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead; 
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently: 
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date. 
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams. 
For all of that 
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story 
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine. 
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now. 
For centures to make him known. 
For changes fated anyhow... 
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass. 
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived. 
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan; 
For evening party... 
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard, 
For fair of the brides her bring, 
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes 
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit. 
For flying glory don’t long. 
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet. 
Forgive! 
Forgive me’. 
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed. 
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens, 
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard, 
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away, 
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light 
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate! 
Forgive, secluded my asylum! 
Forgotten features can remind. 
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends. 
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look. 
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams, 
For her he’s looking on... for nought... 
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming. 
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating 
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring, 
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don, 
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief... 
For his delight were just awaiting. 
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again 
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry; 
For how long? 
For husband then she was yet bride. 
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock, 
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless; 
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes... 
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled 
For long has chance with us to be? 
For long is weeping she this time. 
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood 
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell. 
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing 
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet, 
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart 
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest, 
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart... 
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp, 
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse! 
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling... 
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage 
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book 
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts 
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright. 
For nowhere am I smart... 
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...) 
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks. 
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word; 
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse! 
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby 
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’… 
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast, 
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’. 
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails. 
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm 
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time, 
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all: 
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages. 
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless. 
For thoughtful singing with attention?’ 
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools. 
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days. 
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that 
For what and where do I strive? 
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance, 
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time 
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration? 
Four fatal for the life the stages... 
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume. 
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze, 
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting. 
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him. 
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days 
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time, 
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave, 
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend, 
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn; 
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies, 
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got. 
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day. 
From mountains descends this way 
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one. 
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace. 
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away. 
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters 
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly; 
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv, 
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides. 
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want. 
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code 
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle. 
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards. 
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has... 
Goodness me! 
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear! 
Go on! 
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away. 
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation, 
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes. 
Great charm to any conversation. 
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite: 
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing 
Griboyedov 
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast. 
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended, 
Haphazard wander to prevent. 
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot 
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself. 
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day . 
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady 
Has fallen… 
Has found end untimely hard! 
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit 
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s. 
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone. 
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain. 
Have less in difference between Each one. 
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees, 
Healthy all... 
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance, 
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits, 
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child. 
He came, What news, such sentimental! 
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse. 
He can’t give happiness at large’. 
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires 
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest; 
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead. 
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast. 
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps. 
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast. 
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die, 
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath.. 
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves. 
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him, 
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion, 
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being. 
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear, 
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect. 
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house, 
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail 
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got 
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides 
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed) 
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm 
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day. 
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections, 
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel. 
He hurries up to ring. 
He isn’t here... 
He isn’t more… The youngling bard 
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third 
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete. 
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun, 
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks 
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf, 
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry. 
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation, 
He liked the grove’s timid thickness, 
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon. 
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse 
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes. 
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion, 
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force, 
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly. 
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing! 
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay 
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test. 
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry; 
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting; 
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born; 
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all 
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust 
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think; 
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him. 
He opened a door." 
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe; 
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect. 
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then: 
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed, 
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling, 
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered, 
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out. 
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze, 
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves 
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene! 
Her face but has of wrath a track... 
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling 
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes." 
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild; 
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away... 
Her husband comes. 
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank, 
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing. 
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty! 
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps. 
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though 
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet 
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done 
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve! 
Her role how firmly played, 
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read. 
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt. 
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing 
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish 
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall. 
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never 
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world. 
Her tired look and slipped away... 
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding: 
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears, 
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling 
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned! 
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made. 
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon, 
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs, 
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning; 
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him. 
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end 
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe. 
He’s blessed, who with his love combined 
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house, 
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride. 
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap, 
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve. 
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining, 
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart. 
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine 
He’s killed!.. 
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry 
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise 
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear, 
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his; 
He’s not been seen, none word from dear; 
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon, 
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free 
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old, 
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat. 
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had. 
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up. 
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’- 
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health, 
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last. 
He thinks of here: 
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection, 
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused; 
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games 
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_ 
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good 
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this; 
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease. 
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line: 
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains 
He was afraid of being answered 
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm. 
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once, 
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow: 
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead, 
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all 
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had, 
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near, 
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea, 
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb? 
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold: 
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest, 
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading 
His ardent talk was full of haze; 
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized. 
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile. 
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe. 
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away; 
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land, 
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast, 
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write, 
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times. 
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC. 
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all, 
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore, 
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand. 
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful. 
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away. 
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected, 
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far, 
His letter’s here, quite exact. 
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed, 
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home 
His look was always quick and tender, 
His lunch him answered with politeness. 
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long, 
His misty, foggy gaze 
His morbid and quite dying look, 
His nets for them were so frightening! 
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed. 
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope: 
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections, 
His own works? 
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise; 
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit: 
His pistol then Onegin raises 
His scandal talks were such backbiting! 
His servant Guillot from France, is running in, 
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit. 
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind. 
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes 
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains; 
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us; 
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad. 
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man. 
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression) 
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, - 
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key? 
Hor 
How would you not love Moscow? 
Hurra! we all have reached the land. 
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile. 
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready 
I ask: be patient for a time; 
I…’ -But you are boring 
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation. 
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking 
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made. 
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate. 
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate 
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory, 
I could define 
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives. 
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme... 
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear, 
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe, 
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball. 
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?) 
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge? 
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone? 
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile. 
I don’t mean to please grand people. 
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim. 
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze 
I dread to read again... 
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be, 
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,- 
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay. 
‘I fell in love... you’d get away 
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week, 
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings, 
If I were poet like you. 
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see, 
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash, 
If not... if not, let God deliver! 
If she’s seeing 
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn, 
If their district visits on? 
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love, 
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it; 
I had happened To know many old legends, 
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors, 
I haven’t force... is tired breast… 
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate. 
I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam 
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves 
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light, 
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times. 
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end, 
I lagged behind as their member And ran away... 
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this; 
I liked his features in the past: 
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness; 
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine 
I live and write not for applause, 
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender 
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune. 
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find, 
I’ll take a look and then turn’, 
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find? 
I love him, he’s my kin in-law. 
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed. 
I love you (why should I be cunning?). 
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding... 
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/ 
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us. 
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments, 
I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke, 
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you; 
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess 
‘I’m neighbour just’. 
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss; 
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind; 
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small. 
Impossible!? 
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell, 
I’m unknown... 
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress? 
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia, 
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face; 
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop. 
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs. 
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife 
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about 
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie, 
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme 
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate 
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood! 
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams, 
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams. 
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom: 
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets, 
In crowd everybody renders: 
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat: 
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit; 
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses 
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate? 
Indeed, for long should have the end! 
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams 
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?.. 
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave? 
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart 
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets. 
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel. 
In duels classic, pedant cross 
In early spring of every year. 
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish. 
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting. 
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips, 
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands. 
In fear I was crying, darling, 
In fear shameful heart is sinking. 
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood; 
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast 
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven, 
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows; 
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair 
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit; 
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail... 
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw: 
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing? 
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling, 
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news, 
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise. 
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living: 
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception: 
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading, 
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad; 
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh. 
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow... 
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor? 
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation? 
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes; 
In heaps, forgotten in the streets. 
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod. 
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty, 
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted 
In his first youth he was untrained, 
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said. 
In horror Tanya is awaking... 
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test: 
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time. 
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look. 
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied, 
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling, 
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he 
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand, 
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night. 
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is... 
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way, 
In letters though he again 
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate. 
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade. 
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married, 
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream. 
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book, 
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down, 
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager 
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth. 
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost; 
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came, 
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style 
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas. 
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear, 
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs. 
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson. 
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting, 
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse. 
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective. 
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain: 
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused. 
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks, 
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step. 
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging, 
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions 
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits! 
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways 
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters, 
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens 
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart. 
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom, 
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space? 
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet, 
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding. 
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort 
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest; 
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had; 
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised. 
In tender manner they agree. 
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone: 
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man: 
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,

In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.

In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day. 
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place 
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart. 
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral, 
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels, 
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind. 
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule... 
In winter, when the night’s weak shade

Is really the secret’s found? 
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness 
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze, 
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man... 
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,

It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe, 
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees; 
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never, 
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was. 
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers 
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,

It’s both harmful and absorbing. 
It’s dark in valleys.

It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps. 
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must. 
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call, 
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.

Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same. 
It’s mute for ever all at once.

I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling: 
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew; 
I’ve read it up: 
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate, 
Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;

I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures. 
I was taking you in hands!

I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now, 
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing 
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine. 
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said? 
Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching, 
-Just solemn odes you could hear!

Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself: 
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily, 
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate, 
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless 
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping, 
Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry. 
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!). 
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared, 
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze: 
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig? 
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.

Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line, 
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still 
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon 
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,

Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made. 
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts. 
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters. 
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again, 
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way. 
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park... 
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon 
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen? 
Like victim under charming veil. 
Like women, books were all left here, 
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom. 
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon 
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,

My dashing Eugene? 
My dear early little bird! 
My dear God, you bless and save!

My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed, 
My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck, 
My father gave consent to wed. 
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth, 
My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime 
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.

My greetings! 
‘My habit,.. 
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!" 
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.- 
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits. 
My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance. 
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend; 
My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line 
My Moscow... in this lunation 
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift 
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here 
My muse in ethics well embodied! 
My muse new person just reveals. 
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs; 
My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear 
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she. 
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard. 
My poor mind... 
My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field. 
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever. 
’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait. 
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead? 
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living, 
My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit, 
My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters. 
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!

Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things. 
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision 
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon: 
New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest. 
Next day has come... 
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another; 
‘No’. 
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go, 
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance... 
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets. 
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face. 
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties 
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time, 
Nor makes get up without choosing. 
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got, 
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had 
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession; 
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then. 
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul. 
Not... 
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’ 
Not a word can slip 
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying 
Not Eugene he’s at most? 
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent; 
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit. 
Not grasping ways to understand 
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life, 
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood 
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed 
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent, 
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches; 
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere 
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance. 
- Not, then! 
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice; 
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful, 
Of agitated soul’s feelings 
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away; 
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail! 
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got: 
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame, 
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night, 
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather... 
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs, 
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts. 
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began. 
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables 
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts, 
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating 
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine 
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful, 
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy 
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big, 
Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word; 
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold. 
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time. 
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes, 
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov, 
Of daily troubles. 
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door; 
Of dear friends a pretty chat. 
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end. 
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard. 
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed, 
Of enemy from pistol parried. 
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper; 
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind. 
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly 
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away? 
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:

Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen? 
Of grievous notes of the heart. 
Of higher world the queer ladies! 
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh. 
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why 
Of humble girl some secret love? 
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels 
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race. 
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull… 
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter, 
Of known ladies feet and legs. 
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress 
Of legislator of the halls? 
Of life her features have but few. 
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came. 
Of lively lucid verse’s glow, 
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things. 
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps, 
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading. 
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while 
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze? 
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong. 
Of mind some cold observations, 
Of mind some vague a thought is moving... 
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’. 
Of Moscow young graces good 
Of multiplied his own crank. 
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick, 
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.- 
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard: 
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him 
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while; 
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming 
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams. 
Of own life he could forget! 
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, - 
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation; 
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them 
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love: 
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened 
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits, 
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still! 
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps, 
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear 
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect; 
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile. 
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams, 
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding, 
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations, 
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet. 
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had; 
Of stylish words some ready set? 
Of tears tracks?.. 
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing, 
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later 
‘Of them my Olga is the younger. 
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal 
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope; 
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home: 
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream. 
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close; 
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions; 
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along... 
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had. 
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders; 
Of what a languor’s full her breast? 
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming 
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man. 
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, - 
Of words for songs of prairie districts... 
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss, 
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply - 
Of yard boys family just flies. 
Of years young but whithered hard, 
Of young delirium high rage. 
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call: 
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt? 
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves, 
Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana 
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured! 
O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me! 
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day, 
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy 
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind 
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls. 
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring: 
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above! 
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought: 
Onegin. 
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission 
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks. 
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings: 
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth: 
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven, 
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied. 
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in 
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet, 
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling 
Onegin’s coining with excuses. 
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation? 
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it 
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair, 
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself. 
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling. 
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready 
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door. 
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling 
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up. 
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying 
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine, 
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate, 
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret; 
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,) 
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart 
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head; 
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare 
On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy. 
On leave the gussars hasten here 
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful, 
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit, 
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim: 
On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay, 
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest! 
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup. 
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends; 
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard, 
On steps of world the bard might go 
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man. 
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little, 
On table’s hissing yet, forlorn... 
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave... 
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.

Sad and cold,

‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness) 
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding

‘Shall go forth or should return?.. 
Shall I again your chorus hear? 
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best, 
Shall see emotional flight? 
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky. 
She all is trembling, paling, shying. 
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts; 
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route! 
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad 
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success; 
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures, 
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own 
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp. 
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook. 
She enters a deserted yard. 
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings, 
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel: 
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly 
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting. 
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good, 
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long. 
She hurries up to have a chat. 
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving, 
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again. 
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read. 
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats, 
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one. 
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard. 
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau. 
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats. 
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow, 
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine. 
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong. 
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around 
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness, 
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest... 
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates. 
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep; 
She’s after me. 
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs. 
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow; 
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends 
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay, 
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest, 
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane 
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields 
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs; 
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance! 
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger... 
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot.. 
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light. 
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day. 
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more, 
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy, 
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields, 
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.- 
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last. 
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!), 
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away 
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand 
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer... 
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened, 
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind, 
She thinks: 
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner 
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He 
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades, 
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from? 
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men, 
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill, 
She went away. 
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood. 
Should I begin my freedom flight. 
Sincerely, in grief embracing 
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream, 
Slipshod result of my pastimes, 
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies. 
Some balls, one children’s entertainment... 
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes 
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream, 
Some cold wind just blows. 
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life 
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man; 
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns 
Some foreign words, she often writes. 
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did. 
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden; 
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended, 
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look: 
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue 
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid. 
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids. 
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face 
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen, 
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered 
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up 
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time, 
Some noise by beetle’s raised. 
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked; 
Some other... 
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues 
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention 
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming. 
Some real honour and the pride. 
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed 
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze. 
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives 
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared 
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon. 
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks 
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes. 
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark 
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable 
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated, 
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others; 
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool; 
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests: 
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes, 
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide; 
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made. 
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel 
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself, 
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him. 
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate. 
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance, 
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss, 
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me, 
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted, 
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay. 
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words 
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain. 
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more. 
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling 
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described. 
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends, 
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all. 
Such charming, tender. 
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried 
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay. 
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became, 
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find. 
Such time what can you do in village? 
Surprises deeply all his reeling? 
Tanya, near! 
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?- 
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear! 
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather: 
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand 
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get 
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had 
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling. 
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue. 
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep; 
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why) 
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice. 
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him; 
Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax: 
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin. 
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling 
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance, 
Tatyana steeps. 
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it? 
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess 
Tatyana to the yard, such wide, 
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash; 
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times. 
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify 
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take, 
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed. 
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had 
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry. 
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings 
That dream aroused her misgivings. 
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living 
That gets away of cheecks the flaming. 
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last. 
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender; 
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived 
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear; 
That instant I could trunk with reason 
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression 
That recently I was you christening?’ 
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him; 
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws, 
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)? 
That’s what I am. 
That’s why in French she’s always writing. 
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected, 
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends; 
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours, 
That time to all my childish dreams 
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene, 
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment. 
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand 
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad 
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking. 
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard, 
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed 
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already. 
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give, 
The ashes patriarchal honoured. 
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather, 
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale 
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign. 
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here. 
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me, 
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud. 
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans: 
The beds are made. And any guest 
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those 
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments, 
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence. 
The boy was frisky but with grace. 
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny, 
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse... 
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got. 
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away. 
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite. 
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited 
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars, 
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head 
The Christmas tide for joy is coming! 
The clock’s been striking 
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash. 
The colonel sent it for the chance. 
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own 
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks. 
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate. 
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied... 
The day had gone, but no answer... 
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine; 
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal 
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance; 
The doubts all confused her soul: 
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms 
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions, 
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room 
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses... 
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see! 
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? - 
THE END 
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining: 
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word! 
The evening darkness comes along... 
The evening sky’s more dark. 
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs, 
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return. 
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera, 
The field is dark in pretty gale... 
The fire-place is fading... 
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust; 
The first he made - he left you all; 
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions, 
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes; 
The fisher’s fire. 
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard 
The foes! 
The foes put the capes on steppe. 
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons; 
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands, 
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair 
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings, 
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank. 
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened, 
The further I’m from youth my gay, 
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see! 
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams? 
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while, 
The girls are jumping all around. 
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got. 
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit. 
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended: 
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance, 
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim: 
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance: 
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound; 
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again. 
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook, 
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman, 
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then. 
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,- 
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate, 
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both 
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds 
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force. 
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay. 
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side; 
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine 
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious, 
The inns are absent. 
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’ 
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing 
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard, 
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere, 
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right. 
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;. 
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her; 
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing, 
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks 
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us, 
The letter’s ready, has been fit... 
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie. 
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became, 
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend. 
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand, 
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher 
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day. 
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong. 
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful, 
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her. 
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats. 
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’ 
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze, 
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin, 
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights 
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking: 
The morning pleasant noise arose. 
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find 
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops. 
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day. 
Then bring to Doonya some guitar, 
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France, 
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear? 
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession 
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly, 
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that, 
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs, 
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue 
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers; 
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light 
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky; 
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage 
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit, 
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz. 
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving, 
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify. 
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her; 
The novelty with ages smacks. 
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching, 
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get. 
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth 
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had. 
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray. 
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way 
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind. 
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good; 
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts. 
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees, 
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls, 
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew. 
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet. 
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly. 
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock, 
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine. 
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite, 
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought! 
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves. 
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented, 
The prince as if anew him sees: 
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily. 
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse. 
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’ 
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all. 
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset 
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went: 
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal. 
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks, 
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number, 
The same I was in time of wisdom, 
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom? 
The seasons country views 
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure 
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love 
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day. 
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead. 
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more. 
The shining skies are now blued. 
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill; 
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold 
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere; 
The snow-drift at once is moving... 
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall. 
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies 
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm. 
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out, 
The spring of honour, idol last! 
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth, 
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies, 
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming 
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss. 
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long, 
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks. 
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side 
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore 
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand, 
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once, 
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights. 
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long 
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper. 
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers, 
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard. 
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief 
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading 
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates. 
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies. 
The waters Are still. 
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed; 
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key. 
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone - 
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard. 
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected, 
The wish of heart to whisper her. 
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways? 
The woman says: 
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy. 
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you 
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us, 
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game. 
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions, 
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature 
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom. 
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought. 
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence; 
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess, 
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while 
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams. 
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp: 
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland. 
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat, 
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.- 
They’d better laugh before they had 
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot 
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired: 
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright. 
They friends became. 
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear, 
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face; 
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room. 
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint. 
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means: 
They laugh; the guests are now coming. 
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated. 
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear 
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line 
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust 
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot 
They rush into the yard at once! 
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate. 
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward. 
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring. 
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by 
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle. 
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore; 
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place. 
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end! 
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins; 
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age: 
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see! 
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row, 
This news Tatyana quickly hears. 
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books, 
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous, 
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought 
This way my Eugene was her teaching. 
Three houses will wait for him. 
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy 
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook. 
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one 
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot. 
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away: 
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives. 
Through tears never seeing him, 
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests. 
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies, 
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart, 
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent. 
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range 
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day 
To all these letters, tears, deeds... 
To answer her. 
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find 
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock. 
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures 
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed; 
To be with you I cannot go... 
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid 
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping. 
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran; 
To call some people gets away. 
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell 
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting, 
To come to tables hand in hand. 
To comfort sorrow and grief. 
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book. 
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook 
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already 
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests 
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian. 
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go: 
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send. 
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days. 
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave. 
To fix her fate it’s time, I see; 
Together for a time they sit. 
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing. 
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head 
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!.. 
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention: 
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce. 
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while, 
To guess the windy youth is trying 
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile, 
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time. 
To have a talk with her he tried 
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear 
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins. 
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had 
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time. 
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again 
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing: 
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive, 
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted 
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike. 
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though, 
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same: 
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms! 
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind. 
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last. 
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up 
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile. 
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit. 
To judgings by the world severe 
To keep the happy stirrup dare... 
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily… 
To leave the world I would he sorry. 
To Lensky he could listen smiling. 
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself, 
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine. 
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd, 
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!? 
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come; 
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming 
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints 
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’ 
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap. 
To meet princess. 
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed. 
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37) 
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life, 
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine... 
To me true compass now lend 
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny. 
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show... 
To Moscow, they need good things.’.., 
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid. 
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed». 
Too long the silence’s now seeming... 
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.- 
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up. 
To part Eke friend, but real, eager. 
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day, 
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse 
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock. 
To play the cards was used with me. 
- To pour half-glass you do a favour... 
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing. 
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing, 
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read, 
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber, 
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’ 
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying. 
To ride a horse in steppe severe? 
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last. 
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?) 
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere; 
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times, 
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing: 
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight. 
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write, 
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs; 
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting. 
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast. 
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all. 
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart, 
To them He paid his all attention then. 
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts, 
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave; 
To touch in splendid admiration. 
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank. 
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine. 
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want! 
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one 
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore. 
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume, 
To walk? 
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck! 
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you! 
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify, 
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’ 
To whom my vice is not a harm? 
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad 
To write about otherself As if about ownself? 
To you	give with my endeavours And bows. 
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you; 
To you I’m greatful! 
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping. 
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments 
Turned off, then yawned and said at once: 
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate. 
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking. 
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook 
Two pistols in a row, 
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid) 
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line 
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”. 
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive; 
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled, 
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths. 
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid) 
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone... 
Unmoving, lone he’s again. 
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace. 
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine. 
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away. 
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty 
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten; 
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues. 
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation; 
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs. 
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast. 
Upstairs to the highest rate. 
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past; 
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry. 
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got. 
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got 
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold 
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness 
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice. 
Was asking Olya him at once 
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’ 
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused? 
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach. 
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines, 
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn; 
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more. 
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall; 
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth. 
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed. 
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust. 
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved, 
Was talking much of them with pride. 
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe, 
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side 
Was too afraid, I must confess... 
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained. 
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep 
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got, 
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins. 
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us; 
We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay. 
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule; 
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions 
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter? 
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,. 
Well have the music regimental! 
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said. 
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing 
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me! 
Well, I remember... has he gone? 
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen. 
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears), 
Well, many trifles like the bra. 
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl 
‘Well, no, just the same... 
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself: 
Well, to present you I shall try’ 
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less; 
We must meanwhile 
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer 
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb. 
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze. 
We sing of their lucky fate And glory! 
We them remind about us... 
What? 
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly? 
What a whim... 
‘What big is Tanya! 
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger. 
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold... 
What does next day for me prepare? 
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts: 
What does the kinsfolk mean namely? 
What do you want to ask, you say! 
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you 
What foolish, dumpy is this place! 
What for to grieve? 
What for would ever view 
What for yet here has he been? 
‘What for you early disappeared?’ 
What for you visited all us? 
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison! 
What happened, what a strange a dreamt 
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless? 
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon… 
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance! 
What kind’s he now anyhow? 
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine! 
What languid is her gaze guile charming: 
What more you want? 
What purpose? 
What roses, you can be judging, 
-What said the satirist, remember! 
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper: 
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away. 
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim 
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…- 
What’s my Onegin? 
What’s the end? 
What’s use? 
What was the sequence of the meeting? 
‘What way? 
What will he choose for his engagement? 
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young 
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest 
‘What, you are married! didn’t know! 
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away, 
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day. 
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling 
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly 
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me. 
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far, 
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone; 
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries, 
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear), 
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about 
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames 
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly 
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm 
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn, 
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work, 
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime? 
Where is it better? 
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’ 
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration 
Where we have never been. 
Which are half-funny and half-mournful, 
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig. 
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest, 
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is 
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right, 
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, - 
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that 
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty 
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive. 
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra. 
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t... 
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful, 
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone... 
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little, 
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette! 
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass 
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail; 
‘Whith Olga what could happen? 
Who carefully us can cherish? 
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards, 
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected, 
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs? 
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain, 
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning; 
Who helps from slander not to perish? 
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends? 
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage, 
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig. 
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections 
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew. 
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide; 
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints, 
‘Who might be thinking... all the time! 
Whom you’d be trusting? 
Who never bores us by his charm? 
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling: 
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself. 
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself. 
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward 
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man! 
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt 
Who’s he? 
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays, 
Who’s that, which never us betrays? 
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’, 
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life. 
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it. 
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done, 
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there. 
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes 
Why! out of the country thickets...’ 
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it? 
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure 
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man; 
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well. 
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’ 
Will take the twilight of my days. 
With age the life is such a badness...’ 
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males. 
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine: 
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal, 
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry, 
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs. 
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming, 
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner... 
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this. 
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry 
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit 
With clear soul 
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking 
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious 
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man, 
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise. 
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God! 
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles. 
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word - 
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky 
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes, 
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch. 
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had. 
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud, 
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields, 
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle 
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest: 
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter; 
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ . 
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge. 
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap, 
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends 
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit. 
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way; 
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above. 
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust. 
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit, 
With kin to meet 
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men; 
With love friends’ notions I’d rate 
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking, 
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us. 
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife 
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend! 
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates. 
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing; 
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me: 
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours, 
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance. 
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels, 
Without answer. 
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him. 
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays; 
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness: 
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day 
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm 
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile 
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones. 
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error; 
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit. 
Without them Onegm’s pictured. 
With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv 
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last; 
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided 
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait, 
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend, 
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain 
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading, 
With reason I remembered them. 
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image; 
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse! 
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside. 
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth. 
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy; 
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age, 
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face, 
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly 
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world. 
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining; 
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit 
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be. 
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms... 
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that: 
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright, 
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife, 
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth. 
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits! 
With which to start? 
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty, 
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone, 
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect? 
With you I now tears shed; 
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say, 
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal 
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises; 
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends, 
- Yes and no yet. 
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before 
Yes, It is he... 
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits. 
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll; 
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire, 
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light 
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains, 
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit; 
Yet does it whirl the world and us: 
Yet limpid is the near wood 
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book. 
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing, 
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine; 
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep; 
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping; 
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice 
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans, 
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear; 
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily, 
You alone Among anxieties in still 
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact: 
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! - 
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently, 
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind.. 
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved, 
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding 
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give 
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady: 
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day 
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are? 
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry, 
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening 
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ? 
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader! 
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy; 
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near; 
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least... 
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce 
You help my doubts to resolve: 
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had. 
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day. 
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’ 
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper, 
You listen to my grievous call: 
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear 
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days. 
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand. 
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope 
You’ll see: they all become the bosh 
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive. 
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails. 
You, Moscow, I thought of you! 
You must remember that day time, 
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone. 
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints 
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside 
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way. 
You now bless long years’ work 
You now come to rooms, the inner... 
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet, 
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone. 
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole. 
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat 
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart, 
You see, by skies its predestined: 
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,- 
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul; 
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my... 
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’ 
You take my set of florid rhymes 
- You tell me, nanny, 
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind, 
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad; 
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’ 
You write the odes, gentlemen, 
Zaretsky cautiously could lay 
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals: 
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared 
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’ 
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want: 
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief, 
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes, 
Zhookovsky
